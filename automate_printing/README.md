# Automate Printing 


Automate printing of all odd / even pages of a pdf document on Linux!


### Instruction
1. Run the `printOdd.sh` script.
2. Catch all the copies that your printer spat out, sort them in order.
3. Place already printed pages back to your printer paper slot in a correct way (as you want to fill the reverse side of the paper).
5. Now it's time to run the `printEven.sh` script that will fill the even pages of your masterpiece.
