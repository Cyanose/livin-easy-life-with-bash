# screenshot_dragger

Definitely the script that I use the most frequently, I have it binded to keyboard shortcut. It's list the directory with screenshots, grab the last modified file and spawn dragon window with the file (big shout-outs to this masterpiece: https://github.com/mwh/dragon) to let you drag and drop it, after 3secs the window is being killed, so you don't have to bother.
