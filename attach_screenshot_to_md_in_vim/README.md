# Attach screenshot last screenshot to your markdown file

<<<<<<< HEAD
The script grabs the name of the last modified screenshot that can be found in your screenshots directory, produces the markdown 'statement' that attaches the file, and copy it to your clipboard. You can then pull the 'markdown code' from your clipboard and paste in in your glorious one and only editor of choice which we all know is NeoVim. Another script is the script that should be called instead of just md2pdf program if you want to get rid of resources needed for pdf compilation (copy of images that you want to attach, stored in the `.resources` directory). In order to use the screenshot grabbing script from inside VIM, I suggest to put the script somewhere on the $PATH, so that you can call it as  vim command `:!  name_of_script`. I also suggest to set up an alias `md2pdf='bash path_to_md2pdf_wrapper_script'` so that no .resources folder is left after pdf compilation.
