# Attach screenshot last screenshot to your markdown file

The script grabs the name of the last modified screenshot that can be found in your screenshots directory, produces the 'mardown code' that attaches this image, copy it to your clipboard and copy this file to the `.resources` hidden directory in the current working directory (Needed for `md2pdf` tool in order to compile successfully). You can then pull the 'markdown code' from your clipboard and paste it in your editor of choice which we all know should be NeoVim. In order to use the screenshot grabbing script from inside VIM, I suggest to put the script somewhere on the $PATH, so that you can call it as  vim command `:!  name_of_script`.
